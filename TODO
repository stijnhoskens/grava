+ fix generics errors in algorithm package.
+ do a benchmark test to see which graph implementation is the most efficient.
+ review LinkedGraph, does it need a nodes set? can't it be a shallow interface? 
+ test if every graph method is properly implemented.
+ create a maze generator for testing purposes (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm)
+ graph conversion?
